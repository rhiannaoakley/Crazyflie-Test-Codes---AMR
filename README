Development Platform for Crazyflie Control via OptiTrack

This repository serves as a hub for the development of algorithms to control Crazyflie nano-quadcopters using the position data
provided by an OptiTrack motion capture system. It aims to create a well-structured codebase that facilitates:

* **Real-time Position Tracking:** Integrating OptiTrack data for accurate localization of the Crazyflies.
* **Control Algorithm Development:** Providing a framework for implementing various control strategies (e.g., PID, model predictive control).
* **Experimentation and Validation:** Offering tools and examples for conducting flight experiments and validating control performance.
* **Extensibility:** Designing the architecture to allow for the easy addition of new features and functionalities.
